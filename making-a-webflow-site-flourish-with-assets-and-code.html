                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Yoosh is an Andoird app that we position as a student messenger on steroids. It aims to simplify student project management by bringing notes, checklists, tasks, and calendar functionality to channels. So, students can easily manage anything inside one messenger.<br></p>
                        <p>The project needed a website and I, being responsible for the whole design stack, had to build one. The website had already experienced a few iterations, but the requirement list remained the same:<br></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The website should showcase the main features of the app;</li>
                            <li>The website should be easy to develop;</li>
                            <li>The website should be easy to update with new content. We assumed that the project idea could have quick but major pivots. It means that updating text and images should be as fast as possible;</li>
                            <li>The website should be simple. It was unnecessary to spend time developing fancy animations, as it can slow down iterating.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Branding overview</h2>
                        <p>I have described my branding development process in&nbsp;<a href="https://potenusa.me/crafting-a-simple-brand-identity-system-for-a-mobile-app.html" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;case study. Hereâ€™s a compact graphical overview.<br></p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/1.png"></div>
                        <p>While iterating on the website the last time, additionally to the identity assets above I also had a constructed Material 3 -based design system.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/2.png"></div>
                        <h2>Creating assets</h2>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, one of the main purposes of the website is to showcase the features of the app. Some of them have already been implemented. Others are waiting for validation before developing. I wanted to mention all of them to shape a better picture of Yoosh.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Copywriting</strong></h3>
                        <p>Before creating the image assets, I had to take care of the copywriting. The goal was to describe features in a way that any student, also non-tech-savvy, could easily understand. I created the general outline of the website first and then started brainstorming the short descriptions for each feature.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/3.png"></div>
                        <p>Once I had good enough options, the green ones, it was time to start designing the images.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Images</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>Yoosh is a messenger, so the screens images I had to design contained channels, messages, and filters (Yoosh use filter to organize channels). Obviously, multiple screens may contain the same channels or messages. To keep track of them I created a simple structure tree in FigJam.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/4.png"></div>
                        <p>Instead of creating illustrations myself which would take an unreasonable amount o time, I used the tool by&nbsp;<a href="http://designstripe.com/" target="_blank">designstripe.com</a>. It allows customizing colors of pre-designed illustrations, so all I needed to is add the Yoosh color palette.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/5.png"></div>
                        <p>I designed the app screens in Figma. It was handy to do it there because the majority of the graphics already exist as prototypes. And by configuring Figma components, I could avoid creating similar elements and keep all instances updated.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/6.png"></div>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/7.png"></div>
                        <p>When all 16 app screens and the hero image were designed, I headed to Webflow.</p>
                        <h2>Developing the site in Webflow<br></h2>
                        <p>Webflow is a powerful tool for building websites fast. The development process was pretty straightforward but had a few things worth mentioning.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Bringing the design system</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>Having a design system certainly made the design more consistent and saved time on choosing the color configurations. However, I didnâ€™t find any clever solution for implementing color tokes and ended up manually saving them to the Webflow palette. That requires further research for future projects. The ideal solution would be to store tokens in some source of truth (say on GitHub) and pull the values everywhere, including Figma and Webflow, from it.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/8.png"></div>
                        <h3><strong>CMS compromises</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>One of the things about Webflow I like the most is the ease of building a CMS. We've been using a CMS for blog posts from the first days of the site, but during the last iteration, I wanted to expand the usage of Webflow collections (=databases). I created a dedicated collection for section headers, which stores the info for the section tag (that indicates the feature grouping principle), heading, and description. So, next time we'll have to update copywriting, there's no need to hassle manually changing the text as it can be configured inside a collection.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/9.png"></div>
                        <p>Next, I wanted to group related features into tabs and configure a collection that would store the images and text descriptions. It turned out that Webflow doesnâ€™t allow you to use CMS items in the tab menu. That slightly ruined my initial content structuring idea. I found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-tabs" target="_blank">Finsweetâ€™s version</a>&nbsp;of CMS-based tabs. It certainly did the job, and we have been using it for quite a while. But its implementation is a bit messy, and I had a bug I couldnâ€™t fix, which is why later I decided to switch to the basic solution - hard-writing the tab menu text via the Webflow design editor.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/10.png"></div>
                        <h3><strong>Improving UX</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>One of the requirements was to keep the website super simple, avoiding adding fancy animations and transitions. However, there were a few light changes that could have a noticeable impact.</p>
                        <p>The hero section traditionally has the CTA, but it wonâ€™t be visible when scrolled out of the area. I placed the&nbsp;<em>Get the App </em>button in the navigation bar to provide potential users with a shortcut for downloading the app. That resulted in having two CTAs in the hero section that looked obtrusive. The solution I came up with is to implement a simple logic: hide the navbar button if there is a CTA in the view area, and show it if there are no other visible CTAs. As the interactions in Webflow can be attached to classes, that logic works with every primary action button on the site.</p><div class="po-yt-embed-wrapper">

    </div>
                        <p>As mentioned above, I wanted to include non-implemented features on the site to showcase the full potential of the app idea. To make distinguishing those features easier for users, I added the&nbsp;<em>Soon </em>badge with a tooltip.</p>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/11.png"></div>
                        <h3>Embedding custom code for pattern generator and third-party services<br></h3>
                        <p>Being able to embed code snippets opens up many possibilities for extending basic functionality. For instance, Iâ€™ve added:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The pattern generator Iâ€™ve developed for creating Yoosh patterns (play with the generator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yoosh.io/pattern" target="_blank">here</a>);</li>
                            <li>A waitlist powered by&nbsp;<a href="http://getwaitlist.com/" target="_blank">getwaitlist.com</a>;</li>
                            <li>Privacy and Cookie policies that have been generated using Termly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/13.png"></div>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/12.png"></div>
                        <div class="po-img-wrapper"><img src="assets/img/case-study-two/14.png"></div>
                        <h2>Thoughts &amp; Learnings<br></h2>
                        <p>After several iterations on&nbsp;<a href="http://yoosh.io/" target="_blank">yoosh.io</a>, I have noticed that my design workflow has become more organized and effective. My current Figma skills allow me to quickly design graphical assets and bring them to a Webflow site. There is plenty of space for improvement, though.</p>
                        <p>Trying to interact with the design system myself while building the Webflow site revealed improvement points. For instance, there should be a single source of truth that stores all design tokens. Then the values could be pulled everywhere: to an Android app, web app, Webflow, and Figma.</p>
                        <p>One important insight was that if a platform doesnâ€™t provide the desired functionality, it can be extended by embedding custom code. Developing the Yoosh pattern generator, surely, enhanced my humble Javascript skills.</p>
                        <p>I will keep updating and improving the website. Some of the ideas are: getting the CMS working with tabs, providing the hero section with more impressive graphics (for example, interactive 3D animation), and adding a video pitch to give visitors a better image of the problem that Yoosh is trying to solve.</p>
